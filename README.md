# HexMetal
Toolhead carriage designed for SLM printing and use in the Hex Zero printer or any other front-facing MGN9H rail printer.

This is based on the **incredible** work Alex has done designing the Hex Zero.

Go and get yourself an awesome ant-sized printer: https://github.com/Alexander-T-Moss/Hex-Zero/tree/main

The .STL and .STEP files for the carriage, along with input shaping results will be uploaded once this is tested.
~~Currently awaiting the first prototype by PCBWay :)~~

Received, belt path needs to be widened but all else is OK. New ETA: When I receive and test new part :)

For now enjoy this render!
